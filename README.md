## 🚀 Projects

### 🥚 [Tamago-Shell](https://github.com/OursBlanc42/holbertonschool-simple_shell)
Tamago-Shell is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter developed as part of my training at Holberton School.

### 🧩 🎅 [enigme.christmast](https://enigme.christmas)
A Christmas-themed treasure hunt I created for fun and learning. The goal is to solve riddles online to send your "letter to Santa" and win a video game. It will ends November 30, 2025.
The source code is not on GitHub for now to avoid spoiling the answers, but once the hunt ends (either a winner is found or the deadline is reached), I’ll publish the solutions and code on GitHub.
